# Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles, each day at midnight a new problem gets released on the website and the people who finish it first get the most amount of points.
I don't know how fast I will be able to solve the problems, but I do get one point for just answering the question correctly so hopefully I at least have 25 points by the end of the month. 
I will update the README with my score at the end of the 25 days so you can see how I did.
